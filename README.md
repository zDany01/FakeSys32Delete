It supports 9 Languages that are:
1. Italian
2. Korean
3. Dutch
4. Spanish
5. Franch
6. Russian
7. Portuguese
8. Japanese
9. English

If the your system language isn't present in this list, the program will default to English.
## Download
I recommend downloading and compiling the app for yourself so you can change the application properties to hide it furthermore.
<br>
But you can also download the precompiled binary [here](https://github.com/zDany01/FakeSys32Delete/releases/download/v1.0/diskpart.exe).
